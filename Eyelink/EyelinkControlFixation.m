%
% INPUT:
%   P                 = Struct with field P.el created during EyelinkStart
%   Tmin              = mininum time a subject should look at loc
%   Tmax              = maximum time after which, in case of no fixation at
%                       target, a recalibration is started and
%                       'didrecal' = 1 returned.
%   loc               = [x, y] target location in px coordinates
%   maxDegDeviation   = how many degree is the subject allowed to deviate
%                       from the target?
%   eyelinkconnected  = if it's not connected (0), function does nothing
%                       and simply returns current time.
%   pixperdeg         = how many pixels form one degree?
%   dorecal           = if true (default), see Tmax. If false, didrecal is 
%                       still 1, but no recalibration ist started. 
%
%
% OUTPUT:
%   didrecal          = Is 1, in case the subject did not fixate for Tmax
%                       and we recalibrated.
%   FixationOnset     = Time, when the subject started fixating at target.
